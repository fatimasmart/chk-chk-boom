        <p>my favorite hobby is doing swimming its had a lot of exercise which is great for the body, it freshens me up alot right now im great at it, its very fun to do. I have seen alot of olympic swimmers and they are so cool i was amazed by looking at,I try to do that some times but i failed then the water went up my nose it feels stingy for a moment but if you ignore it you wont feel it a bit.</p>
